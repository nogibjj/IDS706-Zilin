# IDS706-Zilin Project

# Objective
1. Use Opendata database and SoQL to query data and perform preliminary data analysis with pandas

2. Find relationship between crash date, location (latitude, longitude) and crashes

3. Use visualization tools (Matplotlib) to provide visualized insight for people

# Dataset
NYC OpenData: https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/

Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95

# SoQL (Salesforce Object Query Language)
SoQL is a query language similar to SQL. They are different that SQL is used to query data from SQL database while SoQL is not. They are similar because they both support various clauses so as to perform complex data query

For more information about SoQL: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql.htm

# How to use
